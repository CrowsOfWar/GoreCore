#GoreCore: A library mod

GoreCore is a Minecraft mod that contains many useful code frameworks. I hope that this will simplify creation of new mods.

Currently, there are many systems, but they are not documented. Also, GoreCore v0.9 has some major changes of world/player data, as well as a complete rewrite of commands.

If you are going to mod using GoreCore, I advise you wait until the API becomes more stable.

Users who want to play Minecraft with GoreCore should download GoreCore at the [releases](https://github.com/CrowsOfWar/GoreCore/releases) page.

Installation is standard Minecraft Forge Mods, just place the GoreCore JAR file in your .minecraft/mods folder.

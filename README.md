#GoreCore: A library mod

Hello there! I suppose you're sitting here wondering what GoreCore is all about. Well,
it's a mod which provides utility code for my other mods to use. You'll need it for all
my mods. There isn't a ton else to say, other than if you're a modder, there are some
pretty cool things that are in GoreCore.
